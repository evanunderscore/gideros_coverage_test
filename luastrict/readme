Strict implements a somewhat stricter handling of global variables than
Lua. There are two basic modes: weak and strong. In the weak mode you
don't need to declare a global but you'd have to initialise it in the
main part of your program (i.e not inside a function).

In strong mode anything not formally declared  (including non-local
functions) gets the whip.

See the examples for more on how to use the module.

Anything wrong or not working? An idea how to make this bettter? Please
